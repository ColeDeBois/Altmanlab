The cytoplasm of the cell is a chaotic regime, but is tightly regulated by molecular motors. We specifically studied myosin VI, a molecular motor associated with sensory cells. Myosin VI has been found to be involved in intracellular cargo transportation. We set out to find out whether myosin VI trafficker, or supporter through crosslinking actin filaments, thereby altering the material properties of the cytoplasm. After conducting microrheology experiments with an optical trap, we have been able to rule that the perturbation of myosin VI in Retinal Pigment Epithelial cells alter the material properties of cytoplasm.
